This online exhibition features a collection of recently excavated finds
from Vani, a major Colchian city. This collection was put together by the
Georgian National Museum with help from ISAW (The Institute for the Study of
the Ancient World) in New York.

In these pages you can explore the exhibition in a variety of ways. You can
investigate the contents of the graves or learn about aspects of Colchian
culture such as metalworking, religious ritual or wine making. You can also
read the myth of the golden fleece and about the region's history.

A series of events accompanied the exhibition, including lectures, courses and
family activities.
