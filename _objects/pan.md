In Greek mythology, Pan was a half-human, half-goat demigod and protector of shepherds. In this depiction he has a deeply furrowed brow and large upward-staring eyes. The beard and hair are not thick, but the latter is formed into clumps of various sizes that project in different directions, endowing it with a baroque quality. His wide, gaping mouth reveals his teeth, which add to his already frightening expression. From the Hellenistic period onwards, Pan was often associated with instilling sudden fear and panic in an enemy during battle.

When viewed in profile, the almost aggressive three-dimensionality of the figure becomes apparent. The strongly rounded contour line suggests that the appliqué was probably attached to a large rounded vessel, perhaps a cauldron.
